#+TITLE: Today I Learned
#+AUTHOR: Mark Costello

This is a record of things I learned that I want to remember. Organized mainly around various subject matter headings.

* Git
** Show a list of local branches sorted by last commmit date
<2017-03-16 Thu>
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git for-each-ref --sort=-committerdate refs/heads/ --format='%(committerdate:short) %(authorname) %(refname:short)'
#+END_SRC
Note: by changing the ~--sort~ flag, you can order things differently.

* Makefile
** Silence command printing
<2017-03-16 Thu>

If we have the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC makefile
  target:
	  echo "running target"
#+END_SRC

It'll print out the command, and the output of the command:
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ make target
echo "running target"
running target
#+END_SRC

To silence this, place ~@~ immediately preceding the the command
#+BEGIN_SRC makefile
  target:
	  @echo "running target"
#+END_SRC
Invoking this:
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ make target
running target
#+END_SRC
#+END_SRC
